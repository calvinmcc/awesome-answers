<h1>New Question</h1>

<%# @question.errors.full_messages.join", " %>

<%# We use form_for when we're creating a form related to a Rails model,
first argument will be activerecord object. If first argument is a new instance of
the ActiveRecord class, for example, Question.new, then the form will automatically
send a POST request to the standard create action url which is in this case:
questions_path %>
<%# form_for @question do |f| %>
  <!-- <div> -->
    <%# we can use f.label and f.text_field to generate a label/text input group
    in this case, 'title' must be an attribute for the variable you pass to
    form_for which is @question in this case
    The label will have a 'for' attribute that matches the ID of the generated
    input field for the title
    The title input field will have a name attribute that is model_type[field]
    In the example below, the 'name' attribue for the input field will be:
    question[title] %>
    <%# f.label :title %>
    <%# f.text_field :title %>
  <!-- </div>
  <div> -->
    <%# f.label :body %>
    <!-- <%# f.text_area :body %>
  </div> -->
<%# this will automatically generate a submit button. The label for the button
will depend on the @question variable. If @question is a new instance, then the
label of the button will be 'Create #{model name capitalized}'.
If you're not happy with label, pass the label as a first argument--
f.submit 'Create' %>
  <%# f.submit %>
<%#end %>

<%= render 'form', { btn_label: 'Submit' } %>
<!-- This line will look for partial named conventionally '_form.html.erb'
     within the same folder as this file which is: /app/views/questions/.
     Partials will have access to the same instance variable as the template
     they are rendered within. In this case the '_form' partial will have access
     to @question variable.
     If you want to pass a local variable, then you will have to have to do
     that explicitly
     In this case there will be a local variable called 'btn_label' withing
     the '_form' partial and it will have the value of 'Submit' -->
